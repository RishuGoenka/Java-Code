Problem Statment : In a tag-based language like XML or HTML, contents are enclosed between a start tag and an end tag like <tag>contents</tag>. Note that the corresponding end tag starts with a /.
Given a string of text in a tag-based language, parse this text and retrieve the contents enclosed within sequences of well-organized tags meeting the following criterion:
1.	The name of the start and end tags must be same. The HTML code <h1>Hello World</h2> is not valid, because the text starts with an h1 tag and ends with a non-matching h2 tag.
2.	Tags can be nested, but content between nested tags is considered not valid. For example, in <h1><a>contents</a>invalid</h1>, contents is valid but invalid is not valid.
3.	Tags can consist of any printable characters.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer,  N (the number of lines). 
The N subsequent lines each contain a line of text.
Constraints
•	1 <= N <= 100
•	Each line contains a maximum of 10^4 printable characters.
•	The total number of characters in all test cases will not exceed 10^6.
Output Format
For each line, print the content enclosed within valid tags. 
If a line contains multiple instances of valid content, print out each instance of valid content on a new line; if no valid content is found, print None.
